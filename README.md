# Spice# <img src="https://spicesharp.github.io/SpiceSharp/api/images/logo_full.svg" width="45px" />
Spice# is a Spice circuit simulator written in C#. The framework is made to resemble the original Berkeley Spice version, but some parts have been altered/improved to fit into the .NET framework.

Unit tests to compare Spice# to Spice 3f5 are used to verify the models. Nevertheless, some small numerical errors may be present as a direct consequence of bug fixes and structural differences.

Please note that this project is by no means meant to compete with existing commercial Spice simulators. The project started out as a means to learn and understand electronic circuit simulators.

Spice# is available as a **NuGet Package**.
